Random release notes for the texture generator & TexPreProc:

- The windows version doesn't compile anymore . It shouldn't be a big
  problem to get working, but we didn't need it, so we didn't support
  it anymore.

- The tests are incomplete. Don't rely on them.

Nice to have:

- The intensity of the light-, attenuation- and shadowmaps applied
  should be configurable. The way it is now, the maps have to be
  modified if the lighting intensity needs to change. This causes more
  work than nessesary and also leads to banding at low contrast
  levels.

- At large levels of magnification, there is a visible border between
  different patches. This is because filtering doesn't work on texture
  borders without duplicated pixels. To solve this problem, we need to
  add a one-texel border consisting of the texels in the adjacent
  textures to each texture and change texture coordinates accordingly.

- There are several places in which the texture generator can still be
  optimized for speed.

- Texture bitmaps are loaded once for each instance of the texture
  generator. They could be shared.

Known bugs:

  None :-).
