This is an experimental javascript debugger, written mostly as
a proof of concept. The goal is to have breakpoints, tracing,
in-stack-frame evaluation and possibly non-javascript engine
debugging features.

You need two externals for now:

clish, the command line processing library
  (http://clish.sourceforge.net/)

libsigsegv, a segfault handling library
  (http://libsigsegv.sourceforge.net/)

To build it, hack the Makefile (sorry for that), compute header
dependencies with "make depend" and build using "make all".

To run it, do "export CLISH_PATH=`pwd`/xml" and run "./tuttle".

If you want to hack on this, there is a slightly useful "make lint".
