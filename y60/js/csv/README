A PEG.js[1] CSV parser modeled after an article[2] by Julian M Bucknall 

To (re-)generate the parser you're going to need the PEG.js package. Make
sure the pegjs executable is in your path and then call 'make'.

Alternativley, you can just paste the pegjs file into the online version of the
parser generator[3] and just download the result.
