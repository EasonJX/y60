The Mac OSX SDL.framework comes without the necessary cocoa main() glue. Instead
these files, namely SDLMain.m and SDLMain.h are provided in separate download:

http://www.libsdl.org/release/SDL-devel-1.2.13-extras.dmg

It is recommended to include these files in the application. Because we have more
than one SDL application we build a small static library and link it where necessary.
